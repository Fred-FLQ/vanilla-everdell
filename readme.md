## Project Description & Purpose

Vanilla Everdell is a simple interactive website designed to emulate some of Everdell's game mechanics. It has been **created solely for the purpose of practicing vanilla JavaScript**. Vanilla Everdell might evolve along with my JavaScript and front-end skills, but will eventually be forked to a web app using React.

Note: If you're not familiar with Everdell, I recommend visiting BoardGameGeek [page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). If you enjoy resource management and worker placement board games, it's really good!

## Technologies & Tools

Nothing fancy here: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a json file to store Everdell's cards information.

Here are the tools I used:
 - [x] [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [x] GitHub (you are there already!)

## References

While working on this project, I used and consulted the websites and references below:
 - [x] Everdell Rules of play
 - [x] BoardGameGeek user Narf Bro [Everdell Tier List of Cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2486042/everdell-tier-list-of-cards-player-powers-adornmen) from which I gathered data to create a json object with all cards of the base game.
 - [x] Codecademy [Full-Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer) until the first lessons of React.
 - [x] [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): a great companion for self-learners! (And no, I didn't use it to write my code. That would be totally pointless in regards of my objective of coding skills development.)
