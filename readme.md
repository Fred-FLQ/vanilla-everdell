## Project Description & Purpose

Vanilla Everdell is a simple interactive website designed to emulate some of Everdell's game mechanics. It has been **created solely for the purpose of practicing vanilla JavaScript**. Vanilla Everdell might evolve along with my JavaScript and front-end skills, but will eventually be forked to a web app using React.

Note: If you're not familiar with Everdell, I recommend visiting BoardGameGeek [page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). If you enjoy resource management and worker placement board games, it's really good and you should consider buying it to play with family and/or friends!

## Technologies & Tools

Nothing fancy here:

- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript
- [x] Git (CLI)
- [x] Json object generated with Python from an Excel => CSV file

Here are the tools I used:
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its terminal
 - GitHub (you are there already!)
